# Extended Wigner's Friend Scenarios

> What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing.

fusion of elements from both Bell Tests and simple Wigner's Friend scenarios.

## Brukner's

**Schematic of the original Wigner's friend thought experiment.** Wigner's friend (F) is located inside a sealed laboratory (L) containing a two level quantum system (S) and a measuring device equipped with a single fixed setting; she contemplates 'I observe a definite outcome'. Wigner himself (W) is located outside of this room; he considers 'I imagine a superposition state'.

## Bong et al.'s Argument

## Frauchiger and Renner's Argument

## Pusey and Masanes' Argument



For completeness, it is worth mentioning that there exist extended Wigner's Friend arguments which do not rely on any Bell Test elements, for example @Guerin et al.; however such work is irrelevant to our results and therefore beyond the scope of this thesis.
