# Conclusions

Having narrated each of our results in turn, it is time to circle back and summarise what has ultimately been discovered. We will keep our conclusions as concise as possible given the length this thesis has already reached.

- We decomposed an LF inequality from @Bong2018 into a CHSH part and a novel part.
- We plotted a graph in our new parameter space generated by this decomposition.
- We used this graph to propose the first ever quantum LF inequality and provided five independent proofs of the upper bound on QLF.
- We used our deeper understanding of the structure of LF to construct a new LF inequality based on CGLMP rather than CHSH.
- We evaluated the quantum bound on our CGLMP-LF inequality and found the states and measurements which achieve this.
