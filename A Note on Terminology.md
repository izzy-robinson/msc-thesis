# A Note on Terminology

> How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress[@Moore1967].
> - Neils Bohr

Scattered throughout the following thesis are many references to 'paradoxes'.  This term can take on different meanings for different audiences within different contexts, so it is important to agree upon a definition if we are to avoid misinterpretations. Colloquially, the word `paradox' is used to describe surprising, counter-intuitive or ironic results. However, formally, paradoxes are defined as apparently unacceptable conclusions derived by seemingly logical steps from supposedly reasonable premises. When confronted with a formal paradox, there are only three possible responses: accept that the conclusion is true, reject the reasoning as flawed, or demonstrate that at least one premise is false. In order to decide which of these options is appropriate, we must first figure out exactly what has gone wrong. Luckily, the types of error typically encountered by physicists can be divided into three broad categories [@Aharonov2005].

1. **Conceptual misunderstandings.** The quickest way to generate an absurdity (or erroneously believe we have done so) is to make a mistake. Any fault, whether obvious or subtle, can lead us astray. By resolving a paradox of this class we clarify our own comprehension but do not discover any new science. For example, Einstein's twin paradox [@Einstein1905] presents a cautionary tale that making assumptions about simultaneity in relativistic situations is dangerous.
2. **Knowledge gaps.** Nonsensical outcomes often arise as a consequence of applying incomplete or ambiguous principles to as yet untested domains. Resolving a paradox of this kind involves extending an existing framework but does not necessitate disproving it; hence the recognition of missing parts is commonly associated with incremental progress. For example, Maxwell's demon paradox [@Maxwell1871] reveals that any irreversible erasure of information is necessarily accompanied by an increase in entropy [@Landauer1961].
3. **Inherent contradictions.** Occasionally, it is infeasible to reconcile opposing accounts without rejecting an accepted theory and replacing it with something fundamentally new. Identifying and eradicating a paradox from this group tends to require an intellectual revolution or paradigm shift, so uncovering genuine inconsistencies can trigger huge leaps forwards. For example, the inability of classical mechanics to explain either the stability of atoms [@Bohr1913] or the ultraviolet catastrophe [@Ehrenfest1911] motivated the development of quantum mechanics.

Wherever possible, the paradoxes discussed in this thesis will be assigned to one of the aforementioned classifications; however there remain open questions regarding where certain paradoxes belong. It is nevertheless clear that, historically, paradoxes have played a crucial role in the advancement of physics. We should therefore study them seriously (albeit whilst maintaining a healthy level of skepticism to guard against unwarranted panic or hype).
