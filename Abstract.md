# Abstract

We begin with a review of the mathematical preliminaries (namely convex optimisation) and the conceptual background (specifically Wigner's friend scenarios, nonlocality and local friendliness) which will be assumed knowledge throughout the results section of this thesis.
Next, we explore a fresh perspective on local friendliness inequalities whereby we decompose each into a Bell inequality plus some novel part. We consider the projection of the local friendliness polytope in this dual parameter space and witness additional structure emerge from the geometry.
Subsequently, we are able to identify the first ever quantum local friendliness inequality; this is proven to be genuine using the sums of squares method to find an upper bound.
Finally, we generalise to local friendliness inequalities for larger more computationally intractable scenarios. In particular, we propose a local friendliness inequality for the 3 settings and 3 outcomes scenario.
