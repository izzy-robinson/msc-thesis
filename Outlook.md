# Outlook 

Over the course of discovering the results conveyed within this thesis, several loose-ends were left untied. These prompt multiple open questions, of which a non-exhaustive list is now supplied.

- We only used one of the derived LF inequalities (Equation 8.9) as a basis for decomposition; if we use any of the other three, we may yet uncover further structure to explore.

- We have the maximal violation of LF from @Bong2018 which is simply a hidden violation of CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$, and we have our own violation of LF which doesn't violate CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$ or $1$ and $3$ but does violate other symmetries of CHSH. Is it possible to find the violation of LF which minimises all types of nonlocality, especially those relating to setting $1$? 

- We found the bound on our new quantum LF inequality. It would be good to find a quantum state and explicit measurement scheme which yields this maximum.

- We identified 5 different SOS decompositions of QLF and have a simple algorithm for generating others. Each of these independently leads to a set of self-testing equations. Could we use any of these to perform interesting self-testing based on the theory of LF?

- When constructing a new inequality based on CGLMP, we guessed $\delta$ and $\gamma$ with coefficients of $1$ and this worked. But could we find anything else by keeping terms in the same locations while setting arbitrary coefficients? Perhaps a family of inequalities?

- What actually is $\gamma$?

- We have a full list of vertices of the CGLMP-LF polytope; we could feed that back into the software LRS and look for the corresponding hyperplane description.

- We have a point outside the CGLMP-LF polytope (i.e. the quantum violation of our new inequality). This brings up the possibility of using linear programming and various forms of robustness to rotate our non-facet inequality and find the facet inequality it lies above. We could therefore map out the local region even if LRS doesn't terminate when telling us the facets.

Given time, we hope to engage in these future directions.
