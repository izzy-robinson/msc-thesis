# Constructing New Local Friendliness Inequalities

We saw in chapter 9 that an LF inequality based on the simplest $3$ settings and $2$ outcomes scenario can be decomposed into a CHSH part and a novel part made up of $\delta$ and $\gamma$. The big question raised here is whether it is possible to find LF inequalities for larger more computationally intractable scenarios. If we want to go up to the next simplest scenario (i.e. the $3$ settings and $3$ outcomes scenario) we should therefore take the associated interesting Bell inequality (i.e. CGLMP) and see if we can construct an extension based on the structure identified in chapter 9.

We initially focus on the strategies which saturate CGLMP; there are a huge set of these. We then add in a penalisation term with $\delta$; this narrows down the search space somewhat. Finally we choose a $\gamma$ such that none of these optimal strategies are rewarded (i.e. they are either penalised or neutral); we start off with a symmetric $\gamma$ then edit it through trial and error. We are ultimately left with the following proposal:

```

Now we have a concrete proposal for a CGLMP-LF inequality, we need to carefully check all strategies to find the LF bound. We do so numerically using MATLAB code found in Appendix B.3. It is discovered that the LF bound on our new inequality is $3$. The next step is to see if quantum mechanics is able to violate this bound. Luckily it is - the quantum bound is $3.69393>3$. 

One potential criticism of our work so far is that we have found the maximum quantum violation assuming the quantum set is equal to the second level of the NPA hierarchy. This is not strictly true as the NPA hierarachy provides an outer bound for the quantum set - there could be a gap between the two. We are unlikely to run into problems as the second level of the NPA hierarchy is typically an extremely good approximation to the quantum set. However, to be absolutely certain, we will find the quantum states and measurements which achieve the bound. We do so by assuming either the maximally entangled state of two qutrits or the state which maximally violates CGLMP and finding the measurements which achieve $3.69$ or close to it.

Note that our new inequality is *not* a facet of the LF polytope; however it is in principle possible to find a related facet inequality. We have a point outside the LF polytope (i.e. the quantum violation of our new inequality) - this brings up the possibility of using linear programming and various forms of robustness to rotate our non-facet inequality and find the facet inequality it lies above.
