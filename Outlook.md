# Outlook 

Over the course of discovering the results conveyed within this thesis, several loose-ends were left untied. These prompt multiple open questions, of which a non-exhaustive list is now supplied.

- We only used one of the derived LF inequalities (Equation 8.9) as a basis for decomposition; if we use any of the other three, we may yet uncover further structure to explore.

- We have the maximal violation of LF from @Bong2020 which is simply a hidden violation of CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$, and we have our own violation of LF which doesn't violate CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$ or $1$ and $3$ but does violate other symmetries of CHSH. Is it possible to find the violation of LF which minimises all types of nonlocality, especially those relating to setting $1$? 

- We found the bound on our new quantum LF inequality. It would be good to find a quantum state and explicit measurement scheme which yields this maximum.

- We identified a simple algorithm for generating different SOS decompositions of QLF; to do this one must simply permute the order of operators in the string $S$. Each SOS decomposition independently leads to a set of self-testing equations. Could we use any of these to perform interesting self-testing based on the theory of LF?

- If we are to formalise the method for finding new LF inequalities based on different scenarios there is still work to be done, as the current approach relies non-trivially on trial and error. This may take the form of understanding what actually is $\gamma$.

- We have a full list of vertices of the CGLMP-LF polytope; we could feed that back into the software LRS and look for the corresponding hyperplane description.

- We have a point outside the CGLMP-LF polytope (i.e. the quantum violation of our new inequality). This brings up the possibility of using linear programming and various forms of robustness to rotate our non-facet inequality and find the facet inequality it lies above. We could therefore map out the local region even if LRS doesn't terminate when telling us the facets.

- It can be noticed that the quantum boundary on our graph of CGLMP against $\epsilon$ has several straight sections. Each of these constitutes a quantum CGLMP-LF inequality. Investigating these is a logical next step.

Given time, we hope to engage in these future directions.
