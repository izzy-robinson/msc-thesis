# A Guide for the Reader

> I wisely started with a map.
> - J.R.R. Tolkein

It can be easy to get lost within long documents such as a thesis. To help prevent this from happening, we issue the reader with a map summarising possible routes through the information. Our intention is to supplement the traditional table of contents (provided by the side navigation menu), which is necessarily limited in its ability to express connections due to a strict linear structure.

**Part 1: Introduction**

In part 1 of this thesis, we provide miscellaneous information which readers may benefit from being aware of before they embark upon the core contents.

- **Chapter 1 | A Guide for the Reader:**  You are here now (in space and time)!
- **Chapter 2 | A Note on Terminology:** As always, it is essential to agree upon a shared definition of a term before using it â€” in this case, the term of interest is "paradox".

**Part 2: Mathematical Preliminaries**

Part 2 of this thesis introduces mathematical methods which will prove useful when obtaining and analysing the results presented in Part 4. Our immediate goal is to lay the necessary technical foundations in a pedagogical manner; we therefore defer any (potentially complicating) discussions about how these techniques apply to physical theories until Part 3.

- **Chapter 3 | Geometric Concepts:**  Relevant mathematical ideas include (but are certainly not limited to) affine geometry, convex geometry, and the theory behind polytopes. 
- **Chapter 4 | Optimisation Problems:**  Linear programming, along with its generalisation semidefinite programming, are pertinent computational tools for solving the type of optimisation problems we will come across in Part 4.

**Part 3: Conceptual Background**

In part 3 of this thesis, we encounter the main areas of quantum mechanics which underpin our research.

- **Chapter 5 | Basic Wigner's Friend Scenarios**  
- **Chapter 6 | Bell Nonlocality**  
- **Chapter 7 | Extended Wigner's Friend Scenarios**  

**Part 4: Results and Discussion**

Part 4 of this thesis utilises the tools and ideas from Parts 2 and 3 respectively to arrive at several novel results.

- **Chapter 8 | A Fresh Perspective on Local Friendliness Inequalities**  
- **Chapter 9 | The First Quantum Local Friendliness Inequality**  
- **Chapter 10 | Constructing New Local Friendliness Inequalities**  

**Part 5: Conclusions and Outlook**

In Part 5 of this thesis, we draw together what we have learned.
