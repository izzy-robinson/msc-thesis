# A Guide for the Reader

> I wisely started with a map.
> - J.R.R. Tolkein

It can be easy to get lost within long documents such as a thesis. To help prevent this from happening, we issue the reader with a map summarising possible routes through the information. Our intention is to supplement the traditional table of contents (provided by the side navigation menu), which is necessarily limited in its ability to express connections due to a strict linear structure.

## **Part 1: Introduction**

In part 1 of this thesis, we provide miscellaneous information which readers may benefit from being aware of before they embark upon the core contents.

- **Chapter 1 | A Guide for the Reader:**  You are here now (in space and time)!
- **Chapter 2 | Cast of Characters:** We briefly introduce the characters (also referred to as "agents" or "observers") who will act as participants in thought experiments.
- **Chapter 3 | A Note on Terminology:** As always, it is essential to agree upon a shared definition of a term before using it â€” in this case, the term of interest is "paradox".

## **Part 2: Mathematical Preliminaries**

Part 2 of this thesis introduces mathematical methods which will prove useful when obtaining and analysing the results presented in Part 4. Our immediate goal is to lay the necessary technical foundations in a pedagogical manner; we therefore defer any (potentially complicating) discussions about how these techniques apply to physical theories until Part 3.

- **Chapter 4 | Geometric Concepts:**  Relevant mathematical ideas include (but are certainly not limited to) affine geometry, convex geometry, and the theory behind polytopes. 
- **Chapter 5 | Optimisation Problems:**  Linear programming, along with its generalisation semidefinite programming, are pertinent computational tools for solving the type of optimisation problems we will come across in Part 4.

## **Part 3: Conceptual Background**

In part 3 of this thesis, we encounter the main areas of quantum mechanics which underpin our research.

- **Chapter 5 | Basic Wigner's Friend Scenarios:** Following a brief introduction to the famous measurement problem, we explain Wigner's original paradox alongside a slight reflormulation made by Deutsch. We then discuss how most modern interpretations of quantum theory avoid falling foul of true contradiction.
- **Chapter 7 | Bell Nonlocality:** The study of nonlocal correlations is an extremely well established research field which comes with a wealth of literature surrounding it. For this reason,
we will not attempt to cover everything one might wish to know about the subject; rather, we will draw out the essential features for understanding what comes next.
- **Chapter 8 | Extended Wigner's Friend Scenarios:**  Recent efforts to combine elements from the previous two chapters, specifically nested observers and Bell tests, have resulted in more rigorous arguments which have greater metaphysical implications for a wider range of interpretations.

## **Part 4: Results and Discussion**

Part 4 of this thesis utilises the tools and ideas from Parts 2 and 3 respectively to arrive at several novel results; these can be grouped into three broad categories, as indicated by the chapter titles.

- **Chapter 9 | A Fresh Perspective on Local Friendliness Inequalities:** In this chapter we decompose an existing LF inequality and probe its structure.
- **Chapter 10 | The First Quantum Local Friendliness Inequality:** In this chapter we propose the first ever quantum LF inequality.
- **Chapter 11 | Constructing New Local Friendliness Inequalities:** In this chapter we generalise LF inequalities to a larger scenario.

## **Part 5: Conclusions and Outlook**

In Part 5 of this thesis, we draw together what we have learned from all that came before. We then consider whether we have uncovered any avenues worth pursuing in the future.
