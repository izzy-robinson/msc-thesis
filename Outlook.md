# Outlook 

Over the course of discovering the results conveyed within this thesis, several loose-ends were left untied. These prompt multiple open questions, of which a non-exhaustive list is now supplied.

- We only used one of the derived LF inequalities (Equation 8.9) as a basis for decomposition; if we use any of the other three, we may yet uncover further structure to explore.

- We have the maximal violation of LF from @Bong2018 which is simply a hidden violation of CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$, and we have our own violation of LF which doesn't violate CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$ or $1$ and $3$ but does violate other symmetries of CHSH. Is it possible to find the violation of LF which minimises all types of nonlocality, especially those relating to setting $1$? 

- We generated several SOS decompositions of our quantum LF inequality. Each of these independently leads to a set of self-testing equations. It would be good to investigate them.

- We found the bound on our new quantum LF inequality. It would be good to find a quantum state and explicit measurement scheme which yields this maximum.

Given time, we hope to engage in these future directions.
