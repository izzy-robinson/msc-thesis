# Outlook 

Over the course of discovering the results conveyed within this thesis, several loose-ends were left untied. These prompt multiple open questions, of which a non-exhaustive list is now supplied.

- We only used one of the derived LF inequalities (Equation 8.9) as a basis for decomposition; if we use any of the other three, we may yet uncover further structure to explore.

- We have the maximal violation of LF from @Bong2018 which is simply a hidden violation of CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$, and we have our own violation of LF which doesn't violate CHSH between settings $1$ and $2$$ but does violate other symmetries of CHSH. Is it possible to find the violation of LF which minimises all types of nonlocality? 

Given time, we hope to engage in these future directions.
